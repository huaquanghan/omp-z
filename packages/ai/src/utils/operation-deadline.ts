/**
 * Aggregate wall-clock budget for ONE logical provider operation.
 *
 * pi-ai retries in nested layers — replay-safe stream retries wrap provider
 * transport retries wrap client retries — and every layer sleeps between
 * attempts. Each layer is individually bounded, but their product is not: a
 * single `stream()` call can spend hours in backoff while the caller sees
 * nothing at all. `operationTimeoutMs` bounds that product. `streamSimple`'s
 * request builder and `stream`'s dispatcher each stamp one absolute deadline
 * per operation (first stamp wins, so the bypass branches and the auth-retry
 * re-entry share it), and every retry site asks, before sleeping, whether the
 * sleep still fits. A retry that would land past the deadline is refused
 * immediately instead of taken, so the budget is a ceiling on silence rather
 * than one more wait to sit through.
 *
 * Enforced in: the replay-safe stream retry (`empty-completion-retry`), the
 * Anthropic provider loop and its HTTP client backoff, the OpenAI Responses
 * transient stream retry, the five Codex Responses websocket/provider/
 * whitespace retries, and the Google + Gemini CLI empty-stream retries. A
 * caller abort always wins: every site keeps its existing abort check ahead of
 * the budget check.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the stream-idle watchdog: that one bounds the gap between
 * events of a live stream and knows nothing about retries, while this one
 * bounds retry wall clock and never interrupts a stream that is producing
 * output.
